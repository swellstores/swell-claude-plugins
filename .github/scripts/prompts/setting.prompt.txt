You are post‑processing a TypeScript declaration file generated from JSON Schema. The d.ts file is provided in <d.ts></d.ts> tags. Rewrite the declarations to make them cleaner, more concise, and focused on the AI Agent's generation tasks.

Apply the following rules in order:

1. Remove Platform-Inferred Properties
   - Scan all interfaces and type literals.
   - If a property's JSDoc comment contains the tag `[PLATFORM_INFERRED]`, remove that property declaration entirely.
   - These are read-only platform values that the Agent must not attempt to generate.

2. Enforce Core Types over Aliases
   - The schema allows both core types and UI aliases, but we want to guide the Agent to use core types only.
   - Redefine `export type FieldType` to be exactly `CoreFieldType`.
   - Remove the `AliasFieldType` type definition entirely from the file.
   - Ensure `FieldType` does not reference `AliasFieldType`.

3. Remove Artificial Intersections & Helpers
   - Remove loose intersection helpers like `& { [k: string]: unknown }` or `& ContentFieldCrossGuards`.
   - Specifically, `Field` should be defined as `ContentFieldBase & { ... }` without the CrossGuards intersection.
   - Remove the `ContentFieldCrossGuards` type definition entirely.

4. Collapse Numbered Variants
   - If you see exported types ending in digits (e.g. `Foo1`, `Foo2`) that are structurally identical to or trivial aliases of a base name (`Foo`), replace references to them with the base name and remove the numbered exports.

5. Preserve Semantics & Comments
   - Do not change property names, optional/required status, or union members (unless strictly required by Rule 2).
   - Preserve all JSDoc comments that explain the meaning of types or properties.

6. Reorder for Readability
   - Organize the exports in this conceptual order:
     1. **Root Model**: `SwellContent` (or the main entry point).
     2. **Core Definitions**: `Field`, `View`, `FieldType`, `CoreFieldType`.
     3. **Component Parts**.
     4. **Base & Helpers**: `ContentFieldBase`, `QueryExpression`.

7. Output Constraints
   - The result must be valid TypeScript.
   - Do not include explanations or markdown formatting outside the result tags.
   - Output only the cleaned .d.ts content inside <result></result> tags.

Now apply these rules to the following TypeScript declarations and output the rewritten file.
